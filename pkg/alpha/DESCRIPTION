Description: Cronbach's alpha is one of the most widely used reliability or internal consistency measures in social, behavioral and education sciences. Alpha is reported in nearly every study that involves measuring a construct through multiple test items. The package alpha calculates Cronbach's coefficient alpha with missing data and non-normal data. Robust standard error and confidence interval are also provided. Future release will add functions to calculate other reliability measures.
